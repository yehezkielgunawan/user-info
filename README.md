## Additional Notes

I have never used Test Driven Development (TDD) technique before. That's why I choose built-in Angular unit test as my testing library and use some elements that I understood.

Why I used Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI?
Those tools are the most familiar for me, and enable me to deliver some mini projects quickly. In other words, it quite boost my productivity.

Why I still use the module based Angular project?
It's a long time I didn't use Angular as my main frontend framework. So I utilized everything with what I know so far.
